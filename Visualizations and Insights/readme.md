As we have the minute to minute data with TRP of songs played, we thought of finding some interesting patterns,
one of which is finding if songs are played at right time in right quantity and whether it is resulting in better results or not.

## First 3 images show that there are some songs which played at particular time, do not result in good TRP
### There is a possibility that these songs are not liked by people watching TV in that time slot.
### These are dual axis charts, with hour on X axis and on Y axis average TRP and song quantity(count) is represented.
